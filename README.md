<h1>SRTP - Super Regression Testing Project</h1>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p> I made this to help me during regression testing. I find that I'm often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information displayed on the excel sheets we use. This is meant to remedy that through the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Displays test steps one by one.</li>
  <li>Users are able to fail, pass, and leave comments, just like they normally would.</li>
  <li>Allows the user to "skip" backwards and forwards through test steps.</li>
  <li>Allows the user to go back and edit previous steps (in case they made an error, adding a comment, etc).</li>
  <li>Allows the user to download their test steps at the end of the project in a neatly formatted text file.</li>
</ul>
